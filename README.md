# Deep-Learning-Canal

To use the weights install Darknet https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

You can also get a visual demonstration of the YOLO annotation creation and bounding boxes on some sample pictures by running:


python3 generate_datset.py;
python3 ethan.py


For this Darknet is not required. We have done neural net training on the Deep Drive Berkeley dataset to use in an autonomous driving environment to detect stop signs and stop lights. Carleton University has a 2017 Toyota RAV4 autonomous vehicle.
